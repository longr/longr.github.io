Robin is a Senior Research Software Engineer with a background in experimental particle physics.  Robin joined UKCEH in 2024 helping establish a new Research Software Engineering team within the Environmental Data Science Group, working on reproducible systems for multi-disciplinary environmental science.
 
Robin has a passion for reproducible research and sustainable software; embedding these within research pipelines from the start. Robin is keen to discuss how they can support sustainability and reproducibility in your research initiatives.
 
Robin completed his PhD in Experimental Particle Physics at Lancaster University in 2012.  From 2012 until 2019 he worked as a researcher at Lancaster University in the [Experimental Particle Physics Group](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/research/particle-and-accelerator-physics/experimental-particle-physics/) supporting high-performance computing as part of the [GridPP collaboration](https://www.gridpp.ac.uk/). Robin is a 2017 Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://www.software.ac.uk/). As part of this Fellowship Robin created and taught several courses on skills and software for research, and created the Research Software Forum - a place for researchers from all disciplines to come together and exchange ideas and support each other in using software as part of their research.  

In 2019 Robin joined the [RSE team](https://research-it.manchester.ac.uk/services/research-software-enginee) at the [University of Manchester](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/) and worked with the [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/); developing and documenting workflows with [BioExcel](https://bioexcel.eu/), and packaging software in Conda and Docker. In 2021 Robin moved back to Lancaster University where he worked as an RSE in the [Data Science Institute](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/dsi/).  Here Robin was focused on supporting the wider community in RSE best practices and developing and delivering training courses in research software engineering skills. In addition,  Robin worked on a variety of projects in various languages, including Python, R and Fortran; across fields such as Natural Language Processing, Economics, and Glaciology.
