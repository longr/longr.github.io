I am a Senior Research Software Engineer at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.  I am helping to setup a newly formed Research Software Engineering Group in [UKCEH](https://www.ceh.ac.uk/).

Previously I worked as a Research Software Engineer for the [Data Science Institute](www.lancs.ac.uk/dsi) [Lancaster University](www.lancaster.ac.uk), providing training and collaborating on research software with researchers across the University. 

Before this I worked as a Research Software Engineer for [Research Software Engineering Group](https://research-it.manchester.ac.uk/services/research-software-enginee) at the [University of Manchester](). Here I worked on [BioExcel](https://bioexcel.eu/) as part of the [eScience Lab](https://esciencelab.org.uk/) developing and improving software and tools used for computational biomolecular research and analysis workflows.

I am a 2017 Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute (SSI)].(https://www.software.ac.uk/) Through this, I have created and taught several courses on various skills and software for research, and hosted Research forums for researchers from all disciplines to come together and exchange ideas and support each other in using software as part of their research.

I previously worked at Lancaster University in the [Experimental Particle Physics Group](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/research/particle-and-accelerator-physics/experimental-particle-physics/) where I maintained and supported the [GridPP](https://www.gridpp.ac.uk/) computing cluster.
