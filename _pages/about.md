I am a (full) Professor in [Statistics](http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/) at [Lancaster University](http://www.lancs.ac.uk/). On these pages you will find information about my research and professional activities.

Please feel free to contact me about my work, you can do so using this form.

My research interests includes developing statistical models and methods for:

* nonstationary time series
* changepoints
* multiscale methods in statistics
* wavelets in time series analysis

I take pride in working with businesses and organizations to "close the loop" - applying methods I develop to time series that arise from business, environmental and health applications.
